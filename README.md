My contribution:

I tried to create a model architecture from strach and achieved a training accuracy of 95%.

 My contribution:
 
  I tried to create the naive bayes classifier model from scratch and got test accuracy of 70%. I tried various hyperparameter values of alpha for Laplace smoothing and found the top 10 predictor words for each class.
